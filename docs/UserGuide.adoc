== Introduction

Something Daily (SD) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app to manage a significant number of academic tasks and keep track on expenditures*. More importantly, SD is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SD can get your tasks management and expenditure tracking done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`TDL_add`**`t/Tutorial 5 m/CS2101 d/12-09 p/1` : adds a task named `Tutorial 5` to the To-do List.
* **`TDL_delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task in the To-do List
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Our product will be divided to two sub-parts which are called `To-do List` and `Expenditure Tracker`. For each part, do remember to add the domain command `TDL` (which represents To-do List) or `ET` (which represents Expenditure Tracker). E.g. in `ET check status`, `ET` is the domain command that leads you to Expenditure Tracker.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `TDL_add t/TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Homework`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g. `t/TASK [d/DATE]` can be used as `t/Homework d/12-09` or as `t/Homework`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `t/TASK m/MODULE`, `m/MODULE t/TASK` is also acceptable.
