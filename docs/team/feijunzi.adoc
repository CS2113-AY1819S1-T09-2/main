== PROJECT: Something Daily

---

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the check command for Expenditure Tracker*
** What it does: allows the user to check how much money they have spent in a specific period and appear a chart to show each expense
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because if a user want to know how much money they have spent in a period, they can easily get the value and see where they have spent directly from the chart.
** Highlights: This enhancement will appear a new window to show the chart. 
** Credits: This feature needs another library which is jfreechart to draw the chart.

* *Minor enhancement*: add the delete and edit command for expenditure tracker.
